    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>_____________</p>
    <p> 
      I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
      There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
      I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; 
      I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
      I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on 
      my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look 
      at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought 
      experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers 
      in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to
      sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be 
      surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise;
      I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in
      Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; 
      I like good books and romantic movies.
      I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
